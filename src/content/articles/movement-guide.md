# Movement Guide

> Having the upper edge in movement can make the difference in a gunfight. Use these techniques in your gameplay to improve!

## [Basic] Sliding

Basic sliding can be used to quickly gain alot of speed.
To slide, you need to sprint roughly 0.5-1 second (depending on the weapon you're holding) until you reach max speed.
Additionally, you can slide down slopes to slide for longer.

## [Basic] Slide Jumping

Jumping after a slide makes you go faster.
Practice sprinting, sliding, and then jumping before the slide ends.
You can use this anywhere, even on flat ground, to move faster.

## [Advanced] Slide Hopping

Slidehopping is a way to abuse the slide mechanic by immediately jumping after a slide.
If done correctly, you should hear the slide sound and receive the speed boost without even initiating a slide.
This makes you do a "long jump" of sorts. You're not stuck on the ground sliding and you go much faster, but you're also airborne, which means you have much less accuracy.
Prioritise using slidehopping to get into cover/escape, and not mid-fight.

## [Basic] Slidehop Chaining

You can start a slide right after a slidehop by holding down the slide key when landing.
This skips the post-slide sprint phase and lets you slide again immediately, essentially doubling your slide length.
